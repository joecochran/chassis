# Chassis

## Requirements
- uses gulp.js for sass compilation, image optimization, and js
  concatenation/uglifying [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/)
- Node is required to get Gulp up and running.

## Installation
1. If you have node.js installed already, skip to step 2. Otherwise, I recommend you install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). Once homebrew is installed, run:
    ```
    brew install node
    ```

2. Gulp needs to be installed globally. Note: if it complains about permissions, run it with sudo. 
    ``` 
    npm install -g gulp
    ```

3. In the project root type `npm install`. This should install all the necessary
components.

4. run `composer install` to get all the php side set up

5. run `gulp` to start watching!

6. you can use artisan to serve this up on localhost and get to work with
   ```
   php artisan serve
   ```
   otherwise, continue to step 7 to get a vagrant vm going.

7. OPTIONAL - A Vagrantfile has been provided with a provision script. After
   [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and [Virtualbox](http://virtualbox.org) have
   been installed, run:
   ```
   vagrant up
   ```
   (if this throws errors, try updating [Virtualbox](http://virtualbox.org).)
   This will serve the site up on http://192.168.5.5

   For simplicity I am running this on a private network, that was, if I want
   to visit http://sitename.dev instead, all I have to do is add an entry to
   /etc/hosts, like `192.168.5.5 sitename.dev` Here's a one liner to accomplish
   that:
   ```
   echo "192.168.5.5 sitename.dev" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
   ```
   Obviously change sitename.dev to whatever you want to use.

## Customizations

### app/helpers.php
This is a growing list of unsorted little functions that are useful. At some point if this grows beyond just a few helpful functions I will probably namespace this to Harlo\helpers and move it out to a Package. Right now its just a handful of functions like `get_gravatar($email)` which takes an email, md5s it, and returns a url for the gravatar image of that email.

### app/composers.php
View Composers are amazing. They allow us to package data and bind it to views when they are called. So if I want to have a list of pages, I can simply include an array called pages with the view itself, and keep my controller clean.

Laravel does not provide a default place for these, and some people keep them in routes, but I felt it would keep things simple if I moved them all out to their own place. If these grow to be too much to handle, I might also move some of it out to a namespace and use this file as a router to the namespace, (something like `View::composer('layouts.inc.cms-header', 'Ramone\Composers\CMSHeaderComposer.php');`

### Ramone namespace.
in composer.json I am PSR-0 loading app/Ramone, which will contain all classes in the Ramone namespace. At the moment, I am just using this to abstract the user, page, and setting creation tasks from my controller. Eventually, the page creator will be a fairly cumbersome thing, so I would like to move it out to a package and create a simple interface for it.
* app/Ramone/Page contains Creator.php and Updater.php, which handle the creation and updating of pages. This pattern is repeated in app/Ramone/Setting and app/Ramone/User. Eventually, I would like to create a generic creation and updating class, as well as a generic set of success and fail methods to call in order to reduce redundancy.

## Roadmap
- Move helpers out to namespace
- All emails for resets, etc need to use [Ink](http://zurb.com/ink)
- Need to namespace all the things.
- Make this more SOLID.
